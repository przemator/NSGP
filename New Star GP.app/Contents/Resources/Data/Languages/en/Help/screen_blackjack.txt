c/u/Rules

The aim of the game is to get card values that add up to 21 or as close to 21 as possible without going over it. If you get closer to 21 than the dealer then you win. Aces can be valued at 1 or 11. If you receive an Ace with a Jack, Queen or King then this is called Black Jack and cannot be beaten. The dealer will always hold on 17 or over.
