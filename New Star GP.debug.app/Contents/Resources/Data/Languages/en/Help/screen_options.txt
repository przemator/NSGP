c/u/Options

Here you can set up the game to your preference. You can also register the game if you have purchased a license key.

c/u/Race

u/Laps
The number of laps that a race will last.

u/View Height
Set the game camera high or low.

u/Pit Radio
Your lap time is reported to you as you complete a lap. You are also warned when your fuel is low. You can turn off the radio with this option.

u/Map
The map displays the track and each car's position on it. Turn it on or off here.

u/Fuel
Fuel load affects the weight and speed of the car. You can turn off Fuel if you don't want to concern yourself with refueling.

u/Damage
As cars sustain damage they will slow down. You can turn off damage here.

u/Tyre Wear
As tyres wear down your car will lose grip around corners. Turn on or off tyre wear here. 

u/Speedometer
You can choose to switch the on-screen speedometer on or off. This displays current speed, fuel, damage and so on.

u/KERS
KERS is the Kinetic Enegy Recovery System. If the KERS option is switched on then cars which have KERS devices fitted can use the boost button to get extra acceleration. However, fitting a KERS unit will increase the weight of the car and reduce the top speed.


c/u/Difficulty

Difficulty settings generally affect the speed of the computer controlled drivers. The Easy setting means they will be slower and will make more mistakes. Car damage is more costly on the higher difficulty settings.

The difficulty setting will affect your relationships, making it easier or harder to impress the boss, pit crew, fans and friends.

c/u/Screen

Switch between windowed and full screen mode.

c/u/Sound

Set the volume of sound effects and music to your preference.

c/u/Controls
